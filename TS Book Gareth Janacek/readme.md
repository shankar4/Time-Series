I have rearranged and limited the material covered to topics of immediate interest to me:
1. The R language for Time series
2. Time Domain - Moving Averages
3. Frequency Domain - Frequency and Power Spectrum

At present, all the info downloaded from the web, as pertinent to Dr. Janacek's books and class material, is at my Googledoc site. Over a period of time, some of the data will get integrated into examples and compiled with knitr, and made available here in that format (as .Rmd and .html files).
