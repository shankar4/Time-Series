## Time Series in R
### From 'Practical Time Series' by Gareth and Janacek
```{r common, echo=FALSE}
setwd("/home/shankar/TimeSeries")
wheat <- read.table("Time Series Data/wheat.dat")
```


tsplot(series): Given a series this function plots the points and joins them with lines

```{r tsplot, echo=FALSE}
tsplot<-function(x)
{
# time series plotter - plots time against x 
# this is the basic time domain plotter
time<-seq(1,length(x))
 plot(time,x,type="b")

}
tsplot(wheat)
```

splot(series): Given a series this funtion plots the points against frequencies

```{r splot, echo=FALSE}
splot<-function(x)
{n<-length(x)
w<-seq(0:(n-1))*3.14159/(n-1)
plot(w,x,type="l")
}
splot(wheat)
```
