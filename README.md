### Time-Series
Practical R programs for time series analysis
The early part is based on "Practical Time Series" by Gareth and Janacek, 2001. I visited Dr. Janacek's website and publicly available links for downloads to reconstruct the material/software covered/used in their book (the original links are not functional). I am sure there are other R packages that can be used in place of any missing packages. This will be done as and when necessary (and documented here).

I will also use 'Dynamic Documents with R and knitr' 2nd edition, by Yihui Xie, 2015, to build dynamic reports (combines narrative and embedded R code that is executed to generate appropriate output).
